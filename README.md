<li> HDD or SSD (Hard Drive or Solid State Drive)
<li> GPU - Graphics Processing Unit (Graphics Card)
<li> Tower or Case
<li> Monitor
<li> Mouse
<li> Keyboard

<li> Power Cord
<li> Motherboard
<li> CPU - Central Processing Unit (Processor or the brains of a computer)
<li> Optical Drive (CD/DVD Drive) 
<li>Fan or Liquid cooling
<li> Anti-Static Wrist Band
<p> I know I know.... You want to jump right in and slap all the different kind of hardware in a case and call it a day, but there is, as always more 
to than that. 
Before putting anything together, make sure you are in an anti-static workplace. This means no carpet and no cats. An anti-static wristband is a really 
good idea to, also you will need your favorite set of screwdrivers. Take all of your components out of their cases and attach them to the motherboard.
This includes the power source, MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO ASSEMBLE THE CORRECTLY! once it is all assembled, make sure all or the components work.
(HINT) Now that you have it all assembled, try sliding the assembley inside the case.
<h2>Cases</h2>
First and formost, you have to make sure that the parts you are buying are compatible with each other and other components that you may buy
First you need to choose a case or tower, There are alot of different choices, the most common are mini, mid, and full size towers. 
<h2>Motherboard</h2>
Choosing a motherboard and case go hand in hand, there are 3 common size of motherboards, micro ATX and flex ATX. You must make sure that your motherboard will fit in your
case. Micro ATX boards will fit in mini to full size towers, flex motherboards will <b>NOT</b> fit in mini tower, only mid to full.
<h2>PSU Or Power Supply</h2>
It is time to pick out your power source. There are so many choices that you can get, 300 watts 650 watts, which one 
is the right one? This is where the question what you will be doing with your computer comes in, for everyday use such as surfing the web, watching videos, playing music, and light gaming 300 to 500 
watt is enough, if you are planning on doing gaming or video and photo editing, 500 to 900 watts is good. Also, make sure that the connecter on your motherboard is the same as
the connecter on your power supply, most motherboards and power supplies have the standard 24-pin connecters. 
<h2>CPUs Or APUs</h2>
Next up, is the CPU or APU, you have your choice of AMD and Intel, your motherboard will tell you if it is AMD or Intel. YOU MUST GET THE RIGHT BRAND! On the AMD's side you have Sempron, Athlon, Athlon 2, and Richland.
On Intel's side you have, Celeron, Pentium, Core 2 Dou, i3, i5, and the i7. Just to get this straight, APUs are Accelerated Processing Units, these are 
CPUs with GPUs built in, this allows for an "all-in-one" deal for a graphics card and CPU. Your next question will be what is Ghz and cores? Core is where
the actual information is processed, you have 3 choices, dual core, quad core, and octa core, the more core the better, Ghz is how fast the processer 
processes information, so 4.0 Ghz is better and faster than 3.7, 3.8, and even 3.9. Now that you have your case, motherboard, power supply, and CPU or APU

It is time to pick some ram, a hard drive or ssd, graphics card, and monitor. 
<h2>RAM</h2>
First, lets talk ram, you have 4 choices, DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4. 4 being the fastest.Before you go and buy ram at your local store, check to see what kind of ram your motherboard supports, on the site your are buying from, it should list compatible CPUs, graphics cards, and ram
Most motherboards will be either DDR3 or DDR4.
<h2>HDD Or SSD</h2>
Next, picking a hard drive or solid state drive, this is another area where there are alot of choices. It depends on what you will using your PC for, Hard Drives are cheaper, can store more data, last longer, and slower. This is because there are moving parts, If you were to open a hard drive, you would
find an "arm" and platters. the arm swings back and forth hundreds of time a second find data, which naturally makes them slower.
Solid State Drive have no moving part and are based off of flash storage, these are up to 10x faster than hard drives, typically these are more expensive
and have less space. 
If this PC is for everyday use and you need a really fast response time than you should most likely pick an solid state drive. If you are a video or photo editor, operating designer that will be downloading, moving, or installing big files to your drive than
you should most likely pick a hard drive, HDDs are more durable than SSD, if you write to an SSD alot you will wear it out.  
<h2>GPU (Graphics Card)</h2>
There are litteraly tons of different choices for graphics cards, which one should you pick? Here is the answer, for everyday use you do not need one, the intergrated graphics and APU if you choose one
will be more than enough, for gamers, you will need a graphics card if you want to play any game with any kind of quality at all. Attention gamer, there are a couple of different configerations that are available.
You have your choice in ram size, max resolution, and fps, or frame rate per second. If you are a really serious gamer, that you play all your games at 1000 fps, and 1080p or 4k resolution,
then the answer is go with the one that is the right price range, that will deliver the performance you need. 

<h2>Monitor</h2>
if you are a regular user then a regular 1336x786 resolution monitor will most likely be the best for you, if you do not have a graphics card, you will 
not get 4k resolution out of your monitor, so there is no need to buy an extremely high-powered, or expensive monitor. 
If you are a gamer, then you will most likely want a monitor that supports at least 1080p, make sure that your other hardware supports it to. 
<h2> Keyboards And Mice </h2>
A regular usb mouse and keyboard will be most likely good enough for you, it is just what you prefer.

<If Things Go Wrong, What To DO And What NOT TO DO!</h2>
Do contact the manufacture
Do not try to modify them yourself
